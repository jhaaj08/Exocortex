# üéØ Dynamic Study Sequence System

## Overview
The Dynamic Study Sequence creates a **single, flowing study plan** that automatically repositions completed blocks based on spaced repetition intervals measured in **blocks studied** rather than time.

## How It Works

### üìö **Single Unified Sequence**
- **No separation** between "new" and "review" blocks
- **One continuous sequence** following master study order
- **Automatic repositioning** when blocks are completed

### üîÑ **Block-Based Spaced Repetition**
- Repetition intervals measured in **number of blocks** (not days)
- Completed blocks reappear after studying N new blocks
- Intervals: 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 blocks based on proficiency rating

### üìç **Position Tracking**
- Each user has a **current position** in their dynamic sequence
- Completing a block **advances the position** and **repositions the completed block**
- System maintains **continuous progression** through the sequence

## Example Flow

```
Initial sequence:    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...]
                      ^ Current position

Complete block 1 (rating 4 ‚Üí due after 3 blocks):
New sequence:        [2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...]
                         ^ Current position (advanced)

Complete block 2 (rating 2 ‚Üí due after 1 block):  
New sequence:        [3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...]
                            ^ Current position
```

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Repositioning**
- Completed blocks automatically move to their calculated review position
- No manual review scheduling needed
- Seamless integration with ongoing study

### üß† **Intelligent Scheduling** 
- **High ratings** (4-5): Longer intervals (7-30 blocks)
- **Medium ratings** (3): Standard intervals (3-7 blocks)  
- **Low ratings** (1-2): Short intervals (1 block)

### üìä **Progress Tracking**
- Current position in sequence
- Total blocks studied
- Automatic advancement
- Review block positioning

## Database Models

### `DynamicStudyPlan`
- `user`: One-to-one with User
- `current_position`: Current position in sequence (0-based)
- `total_blocks_studied`: Total blocks completed by user
- `last_updated`: Timestamp of last update

### `UserBlockState` (Enhanced)
- Added block-based scheduling fields:
  - `next_due_after_blocks`: When block should reappear
  - `blocks_interval`: Current repetition interval
  - `stability_blocks`: Memory stability in blocks
  - `blocks_studied_count`: Blocks studied since last review

## API Changes

### Block Completion
When a block is completed:
1. **Update UserBlockState** with new scheduling data
2. **Advance user position** in dynamic sequence  
3. **Reposition completed block** at calculated interval
4. **Return new position** and scheduling info

### Sequence Generation
- **Dynamic sequence** generated on-demand based on:
  - User's current position
  - Completed blocks and their due intervals
  - Master sequence ordering with prerequisites

## Benefits

### üéØ **Simpler User Experience**
- One sequence to follow
- No complex review scheduling
- Natural progression with automatic repetition

### üß† **Better Learning**
- Spaced repetition based on actual study progression
- Context-aware positioning 
- Maintains learning momentum

### ‚ö° **Efficient Study**
- No time-based delays
- Optimal spacing for memory consolidation
- Continuous engagement

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Study the sequence** from your current position
2. **Complete blocks** as you progress
3. **Completed blocks reappear** automatically at optimal intervals
4. **Continue studying** - the system handles everything else

### For Developers
```python
# Get user's dynamic sequence
study_plan = DynamicStudyPlan.get_or_create_for_user(user)
sequence = StudySession.create_dynamic_study_sequence(user, study_plan.current_position)

# Complete a block
StudySession.reposition_completed_block(user, block, rating)
study_plan.advance_position()
```

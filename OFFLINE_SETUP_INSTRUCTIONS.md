# ðŸš€ Offline Study Setup Instructions

## âœ… What Was Fixed

Your offline study system now properly serves the home page and study plans when offline, instead of showing the generic "You're offline" screen.

## ðŸ“± How to Set Up Offline Study

### **Step 1: Load Pages While Online**
1. Visit your app: `https://exocortex-production.up.railway.app/`
2. Navigate to these pages to cache them:
   - **Home Page**: `/` (main page)
   - **Study Plan**: `/focus-blocks/` or `/offline-plan/`
   - **Offline Options**: `/offline/`

### **Step 2: Warm the Cache (Recommended)**
Visit this URL while online to pre-cache all essential pages:
```
https://exocortex-production.up.railway.app/api/warm-cache/
```

You should see a response like:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "cached_urls": ["/", "/offline-home/", "/offline-plan/", "/offline/"],
    "message": "Warmed cache for 4 URLs"
}
```

### **Step 3: Test Offline Mode**
1. **Go offline**: Turn off WiFi or use Dev Tools â†’ Network â†’ Offline
2. **Visit home page**: Should show offline-capable home page with study options
3. **Click "Study Plan"**: Should work and show all cached blocks
4. **Study blocks**: Should work completely offline with progress tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ What Now Works Offline
